# PacmanProject

Use your arrow keys to control the movement of pacman. Avoid the ghosts or you will lose one life.  Eat all the food pellets to level up. There are initially 3 ghosts for level 1, and the number of ghosts will increase when level goes up.

Extra features:
- pacman can pause the movement of ghosts for 4 seconds when half of the food is eaten;
- ghosts have different appearance and personalities (velocity);
